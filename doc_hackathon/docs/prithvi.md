# 2. Implementation of a ViT pretrained on a crop segmentation task

You can find this implementation in `prithvi_notebook.ipynb`.
Here, we used a promising network already pretrained and adaptated to our task, yet we weren't able to retrieve all the code, so we had to recode part of the network. It resulted in a working implementation that takes too long to train and gives poor results on the few epochs on which it was trained.
